# **Interview Preparation Coding Challenges**

This repository documents my journey through the [HackerRank 3-Month Interview Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit). The primary focus is **not just solving problems** but also **gaining hands-on experience with different technologies**, including:

- **Programming Languages**: C++, Java, C#, PHP  
- **IDEs & Editors**: IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code  
- **Command Line & Git**: Git Bash, CLI navigation, and repository management  

The exercises themselves are relatively **straightforward** and serve as a way to **explore and gain confidence** in using these tools effectively.

## **ðŸ”¹ Repository Structure**

The repository is organized into **week-wise folders**, each containing different coding exercises, solutions, and problem explanations.

- **Week 1 (C++)**: Covers foundational problems in C++.
- **Week 2 (Java)**: Focuses on Java-based coding challenges.
- **Week 3 (C#)**: Includes problem-solving in C#.
- **Week 4 (PHP)**: Introduces PHP problem-solving and syntax.

Each folder includes:
- **Solution files** for different problems.
- A **README.md** file that describes the challenges.

## **ðŸ”¹ Why This Repository Exists**
This is not just about solving problemsâ€”it's about **developing fluency in different environments**:   
âœ” Learning **how to set up projects** in different IDEs  
âœ” Understanding **basic Git commands and workflows**  
âœ” Experimenting with **multiple programming languages**  
âœ” Running code in **various execution environments**  

This approach ensures that switching between different languages and tools becomes **second nature**.
